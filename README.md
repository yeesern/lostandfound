## Capstone Project: Company Lost & Found Report Site App

## Goals and Objective
The primary goal of a lost and found website is to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for individuals to report lost items and help reconnect them with their rightful owners. The website serves as a centralized hub where users can post details about items they have lost or found, creating a virtual community that facilitates the recovery process.

The objectives of a lost and found website include:

Recovery and Reunification: The website aims to increase the chances of reuniting lost items with their owners by providing a space for detailed descriptions, images, and contact information. This helps bridge the gap between those who have lost items and those who have found them.

Convenience and Accessibility: By offering an online platform, the website makes it convenient for people to report lost items or post information about items they've found. Users can access the platform 24/7 from various devices.

Reduced Paperwork: Traditional lost and found methods often involve physical posters, flyers, or phone calls, which can be cumbersome and inefficient. The website eliminates the need for excessive paperwork and phone calls, making the process more environmentally friendly and streamlined.

Increased Reach: Unlike localized physical notices, a lost and found website has the potential to reach a wider audience, extending the reach beyond a specific geographical area and increasing the chances of finding a match between lost and found items.

In summary, a lost and found website's goal is to facilitate the recovery of lost items by providing a modern, efficient, and user-friendly platform that connects those who have lost belongings with those who have found them. By leveraging the power of the internet and community engagement, these websites aim to make the process of reuniting people with their possessions more seamless and effective.
